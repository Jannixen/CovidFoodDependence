# CovidFoodDependence
A linear regression project investigating the relationship between a country's diet and covid mortality. 

## Conclusions
Based on the results, it is possible to evaluate the assumptions given in the research hypothesis:

* As the level of obesity increases, the mortality rate for COVID-19 of a given country increases (positive estimate of the parameter for this variable)
* A more unhealthy lifestyle (higher consumption of alcohol, animal fats) goes hand in hand with an increase in mortality from COVID-19 in a given country
* According to the model of mortality from COVID-19 of a given country increases with the decrease in malnutrition of the country's population (negative estimation of the parameter corresponding to this variable). However, it should also be kept in mind that malnutrition occurs mostly in underdeveloped countries. Therefore, it is possible that in these countries too, the study of the presence of the virus and the causes of death of the patient is much less accurate.
